      <b>The website I would like to create would be engaging and dynamic.</b> <br>
      It would allow the person browsing to make and set their own font, background colors or images. It would also allow them to drag page elements and drop them where it's easy for them to find & use.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size:20px">
      The website would have a color wheel to pick colors for background, font etc. It would have options that would allow them to set their favorite websites as widgets.
